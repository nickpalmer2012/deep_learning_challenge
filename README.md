Module 21 Challenge - Neural Networks and Deep Learning Models

## Overview
Alphabet Soup foundation wants to develop a machine-learning model to help predict which ventures will succeed based on metadata provided from previous ventures that AS has funded.

## Results
### Data Preprocessing
* What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
* What variable(s) are the features for your model?
* What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
